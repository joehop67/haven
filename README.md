# Haven - A Text Editor Written in C

The original starting point for this project is [KILO Tutorial by Snaptoken](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo)
An excellent tutorial that does a supurb job of explaining the code presented in a concise, easy to understand manner.

From this tutorial however my entire goal while starting it was to, well, learn C. The only way to do that, however,
Would be to take this tutorial and to expand on it in my own ways, solving the problems I want to solve and eventually.... Learning C.

As of right now: Version **0.0.1** The code is practically 1-1 with the tutorial. Thus, this is my first commit, my true starting point.

You're going to see some ugly, ugly code here, you have been warned.

Currently, the roadmap that I have planned out in my head is below, but this is my project so i'll probably be bouncing all over the place.

## Current Features
* Syntax Highlighting (For C)
* Find in text
* Buffered Editing
* Support for new Highlighted Languages
* Full terminal rendering support (Raw, no curses yet)
* Saving/Loading
* Display messages on the bottom of the screen
* File change detection
* File type detection

## Planned Features
These are all features that I would like to extend from the current codebase as it is. Make it less "Kilo rebranded" and make it more, well, *Haven*

* Config file support
* Plugin support
* Modal style editing (Vim is #1)
* Line Numbers
* More Syntax Highlighting
* Anything that seems interesting!

If anyone is actually reading this I'll try to keep this document updated with the features I add/plan on adding in the future!

I realize everybody and their dog has built a text editor at some point but I feel like it's a great starting place for someone like me;
An experienced programmer who wants to dip their toes in the C world.
